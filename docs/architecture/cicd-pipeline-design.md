# CI/CD Pipeline Architecture Design
## Context Memory Gateway - Enterprise Deployment Pipeline

### Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline architecture for the Context Memory Gateway, designed to support enterprise-grade deployment with security, reliability, and observability.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Pipeline Principles
- **GitOps-based**: All deployments driven by Git commits and pull requests
- **Security-first**: Integrated security scanning at every stage
- **Environment promotion**: Automatic progression through dev → staging → production
- **Zero-downtime deployments**: Blue-green and rolling deployment strategies
- **Comprehensive testing**: Multi-layer testing with quality gates
- **Observability**: Full monitoring and alerting throughout the pipeline

## 🔄 Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Source Control Integration
- **Trigger**: Push to feature branches, pull requests, main branch
- **Branch Strategy**: GitFlow with feature → develop → main → release
- **Quality Gates**: Required reviewers, status checks, linear history

### Stage 2: Continuous Integration (CI)

#### 2.1 Code Quality & Testing
```yaml
Quality Gates:
  - Code linting (ruff, black, isort)
  - Type checking (mypy)
  - Security linting (bandit, safety)
  - Unit tests (pytest) - 90% coverage minimum
  - Integration tests - Critical path validation
  - Load tests - Performance regression detection
```

#### 2.2 Security Scanning
```yaml
Security Layers:
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
  - Software Composition Analysis (SCA) 
  - Container vulnerability scanning
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning
  - Secrets detection
```

#### 2.3 Container Build & Registry
```yaml
Container Strategy:
  - Multi-stage Dockerfile optimization
  - Distroless base images for security
  - Image signing and verification
  - Harbor/Docker Hub registry with scanning
  - Semantic versioning and tagging
```

### Stage 3: Continuous Deployment (CD)

#### 3.1 Environment Promotion Strategy

```mermaid
graph LR
    DEV[Development<br/>Auto-deploy] --> STAGING[Staging<br/>Auto-deploy + Tests]
    STAGING --> APPROVAL[Manual Approval]
    APPROVAL --> PROD[Production<br/>Blue-Green Deploy]
    
    DEV -.->|PR Builds| PREVIEW[Preview Environments]
```

#### 3.2 Deployment Strategies
- **Development**: Direct deployment for rapid feedback
- **Staging**: Automated deployment with smoke tests
- **Production**: Blue-green deployment with automatic rollback

### Stage 4: Post-Deployment

#### 4.1 Verification & Monitoring
```yaml
Health Checks:
  - Application health endpoints (/health, /health/ready)
  - Circuit breaker status monitoring  
  - Database connectivity validation
  - External service dependency checks
  - Performance metric validation
```

#### 4.2 Alerting & Rollback
```yaml
Automated Response:
  - Health check failures → Automatic rollback
  - Performance degradation → Alert + Manual review
  - Security alerts → Immediate notification
  - Circuit breaker trips → Escalation protocols
```
